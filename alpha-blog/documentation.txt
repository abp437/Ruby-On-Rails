Helpers:
Helpers are where we extract out our common logic only for Views of the application.

Migration Files:
These are basically the files which your application uses for creating tables in your Database.

First we need to build out a route, then controller and an action.

To get paths for link in rails we need to run "rails routes" and then in the prefix part we just need to append whatever prefix we choose with "_path".
e.g.: "welcome_home" becomes "welcome_home_path"
