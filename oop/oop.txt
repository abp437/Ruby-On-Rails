Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to design and program applications

- Allows the program to block off areas of code that perform certain tasks independently of other areas in the application.

Encapsulation - concept of blocking off areas of code and not making it available to the rest of the program

Abstraction - is simplifying a complex process of a program, an enterprise software solution for example by modeling classes appropriate for it

Inheritance - is used where a class inherits the behavior of another class, referred to as the superclass

Polymorphism - is when a class inherits the behaviors of another class, but has the ability to not inherit everything and change some of itâ€™s inherited behaviors. For example to write a method that does something differently from the inherited method

Classes - It is a blueprint that describes the state and behavior that the objects of the class all share. A class can be used to create many objects. Objects created at runtime from a class are called instances of that particular class.

Ruby has Single Inheritance implemented in it.
So if you want Multiple Inheritance, you need Modules.
Modules can't be instantiated, but we can use Module methods on Class instances.
You can include multiple modules inside a Class.
If we use include - all module methods will become instance methods of class.
If we use extend - all module methods will become class methods of class.
