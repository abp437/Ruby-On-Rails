config.ru:
This file loads up our environments and run our Rails Application. This file is the rack up file that says we want to run a web sever and rack is a tool that helps us build a web server. This file can also run on Sinatra since it's also a rack based framework.

boot.rb:
The boot file loads up our Gemfile and runs bundler to setup our gems.

application.rb:
Loads up boot file and also rails. It also requires the Rails groups based upon the environment such as production or development. We an also set up global config items. Example, language.

environments directory:
This is where we set up our development, production and test configs.

initializers directory:
Nothing specific to note but just initialize out application with different gems.

locales directory:
We store the language.yml files here.

database.yml:
This file specifies different environments and also the dbs to be used for each environment, also the db such as Postgres or MySQl or SQlite. If you are going to use any db other than SQlite then you need to add a username and password as well in defaults. Each environment will inherit from default, but if you want to override using environment specific stuff you can do so. But we don't store up our usernames and passwords in raw format, so we need to store that in secrets.yml file. But secrets.yml are deprecated now in favor of encrypted secrets, which is now the credentials.yml.enc file.

environment.rb:
This file actually requires the application.rb file. So the rackup file requires this file which in turn requires the application file.

bin directory:
This directory has got the executables, such as rails, rake, bundle.

controllers directory:
This has got the business logic.

concerns directory:
This has got the repeated structure in controllers or models.
